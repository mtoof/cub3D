At the moment we have not include the mlx library in the repo yet. So you need mlx library and adjust the Makefile to compile with the mlx directory to run this project.

üéØ Project Aim: Elevating Dimensions with the Ray Casting Technique

üîó [Watch more projects on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vuphong3349/videos)

Welcome to our innovative project, where we ambitiously venture into the realm of graphical transformation, converting 2D visuals into immersive 3D experiences by harnessing the power of the Ray Casting technique. This project is not merely a demonstration of graphical conversion but a testament to the seamless integration of mathematical computations and graphical rendering to create a visually stunning and interactive 3D environment from a 2D base.

üöÄ Embarking on a 3D Journey

The journey from 2D to 3D is a meticulous process, involving intricate calculations, understanding light physics, and implementing precise algorithms to ensure that the transformation is not only visually appealing but also technically sound. Ray Casting, a technique that involves sending rays from a point (the camera) into a scene to detect collisions and render objects, plays a pivotal role in this transformation. Our implementation of this technique ensures that the 3D environment is rendered with accurate perspectives, providing a genuine spatial experience.

üé® Art Meets Technology

In this project, art and technology intertwine to create a symphony of pixels that dance in three-dimensional space, providing a rich, immersive user experience. The 2D version, while simplistic, serves as the foundation upon which complex algorithms work their magic, casting rays that breathe life into a static image, morphing it into a vibrant 3D space.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Proficiency and Challenges

Navigating through the challenges of implementing the Ray Casting technique, we encountered and solved numerous problems related to computational efficiency, accurate distance calculations, and realistic rendering. The technical proficiency demonstrated in this project extends beyond mere coding capabilities, reflecting a deep understanding of computer graphics, algorithmic optimizations, and software engineering principles.

ü§ù Collaboration and Learning

This project, while a technical endeavor, has also been a journey of collaborative learning and knowledge sharing. Our team, comprising individuals with diverse skills and expertise, worked cohesively to divide, conquer, and navigate through the myriad of challenges encountered during development. Through consistent communication, mutual learning, and collective problem-solving, we ensured that the project not only reached but exceeded our initial expectations.

üåê Global Reach and Future Prospects

While our project has achieved significant milestones, we envision it reaching global developers and enthusiasts, serving as a learning platform and inspiration for future 3D rendering projects. We invite developers, graphic designers, and 3D modeling enthusiasts to explore, contribute, and collaborate, ensuring that the project evolves and continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in 3D rendering.
